Here at Procore, we are all in this together and we consider you — our Integration Partners — part of the Procore family.
Because of this, we love to hear about our mutual wins! In an effort to make it as easy for you as possible, we’ve created this fast, easy template where you can send us our mutual client success stories.
All you have to do is download this template, interview a mutual client, attach the correct logos, and send it our way to <partnership-requests@procore.com> and we will do all of the heavy lifting from there.

Please Note: Not all case studies that are submitted will be published by Procore and it may take some time before we can reply to all submissions.
Before submitting, please seek approval from the mutual client regarding publishing the case study and submitted facts.
Please be sure to also email any eps files for both partner and mutual client to <partnership-requests@procore.com>.
