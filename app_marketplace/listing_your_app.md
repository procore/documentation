## Partner Vetting & Agreement
To ensure the quality and value of our partner ecosystem, we require that every prospective partner complete a vetting process, then sign the Procore Framework Agreement and Technology Partner Addendum. It's important to note that we do not accept redlines or changes to the agreements.

When your app meets all requirements and has been validated with a customer, you can apply to the **Procore Technology Partner Program** directly from your app’s **Marketplace Listing** section in the Developer Portal.

To apply, you'll:
1. Complete the Procore vetting review process.
2. Sign the Procore Framework Agreement and Technology Partner Addendum.
3. Receive your signed agreements via email.

Once submitted, our team will initiate the vetting process. Once the vetting process has been completed, we will review your application and contact you regarding the status of your application and next steps.

To review the agreements and expectations in advance, see the <a target="_blank" href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/8pep15rt0kef/3p5N8hUCPqxO2d7qIfym0B/05f433ed5d2d4a99d1a1eea8364c6895/partner-framework-agreement.pdf">Framework Agreement & Tech Partner Addendum</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/8pep15rt0kef/Owy2JJPZE8QDSaxL2QXAj/8896c4afe4136f9cd2f14111e29208ac/Procore_Partner_Code_of_Conduct.pdf">Partner Code of Conduct</a>.

## Marketplace Listing Guidelines
Once you are approved as a Procore Technology Partner, you’ll gain access to finalize and submit your Marketplace listing.

Your listing serves as the public-facing introduction to your app — making it a key driver of visibility, customer interest, and engagement. It’s important to clearly communicate what your app does, who it benefits, and why customers should install it.

A few quick best practices:
- **App Title:** Keep it simple and searchable (e.g., “Box”, “OneDrive”).
- **Video:** Keep it concise (1–3 minutes) and highlight how your app integrates with and enhances Procore workflows.
- **Screenshots:** Use clear, high-quality images that showcase your app’s key features and customer benefits.

For full field explanations and requirements, see the [Marketplace Listing Guidelines]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link app_marketplace/marketplace_listing_guidelines.md %}).
<br><br>

***
## Submitting Your App for Review
After your Partner application is approved and your Marketplace Listing is ready, your app will undergo a final validation review.

This step ensures your app meets Procore’s standards for functionality, security, and user experience before it goes live.

During validation, you’ll:
- Submit your completed Marketplace Listing (including screenshots, icons, descriptions, etc.)
- Share a short demo video showing how the app works in Procore
- Incorporate feedback from the Marketplace team, if needed
- Finalize production deployment of your app

Once your app passes validation, it will be published and visible on the Procore Marketplace.

For additional validation details, see the [Marketplace Approval Checklist]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link app_marketplace/marketplace_checklist.md %}).
