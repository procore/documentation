## Introduction
Once your app is approved and published, it becomes visible to customers and prospects on the Procore Marketplace, where they can view your listing or install the app. These actions are tracked and made available to you through the App Metrics dashboard in the <a href="https://developers.procore.com/developers" target="blank">Procore Developer Portal</a>, directly in your app.

## Metrics
### Marketplace Views
A Marketplace View is logged when a customer or prospect visits your app listing. The following data is tracked and displayed in your dashboard:

- Total page views.
- Page views over a specified time period.

### App Installations
An App Installation occurs when a customer installs your app from the Procore Marketplace or via a custom installation. The metrics provided include:

- Total Procore Company Account installations.
- Installations over time.
- The name of the Procore Company Account.
- Dates of installation or un-installation.

## Increasing Sales Conversation Rate
Conversion Rate measures how effectively your listing content persuades prospective Procore customers to install your app. While other factors like direct sales engagement, customer referrals, or marketing efforts may influence a decision, the conversion rate specifically tracks visits to your app listing and subsequent installations.

Use conversion rate as an indicator rather than the sole measure of success. To maximize conversions, ensure your listing content clearly communicates your app's value proposition to undecided customers.

It's best practice to monitor how content updates impact conversion rates. Regularly refine your listing based on customer feedback to continuously improve your app's appeal.
