## Introduction
Welcome! The Procore Developer Portal is your starting point for building powerful integrations that connect with the Procore platform and provide value to construction teams worldwide.

This section offers the resources, documentation, and tools you need to **start building your integration today**. After developing your app, you’ll have the opportunity to apply to the **Procore Technology Partner Program** and list your app on the **Procore Marketplace**.

Our goal is to make it as seamless as possible for you to develop innovative solutions that integrate with Procore’s leading construction management platform.

Please note, becoming an official Procore Technology Partner and listing on the marketplace are subsequent steps after building a functional integration.

## Want to Review the Partner Agreement Before Building?
We recommend reviewing our <a target="_blank" href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/8pep15rt0kef/3cqMPZK5V9dt5VM9WvL4hA/9489b69ecdf426bd957f7fdb2ce541d6/Procore_Partner_Program_Guide.pdf">Partner Program Guide</a> & <a target="_blank" href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/8pep15rt0kef/3p5N8hUCPqxO2d7qIfym0B/05f433ed5d2d4a99d1a1eea8364c6895/partner-framework-agreement.pdf">Terms</a> early in your journey. The Program Guide outlines what to expect regarding partner tiers, benefits, and associated fees, while the Partner Agreements detail the legal terms you’ll need to agree to before listing your app on the Marketplace. Familiarizing yourself with both early on can help you plan your integration and go-to-market strategy more effectively.
