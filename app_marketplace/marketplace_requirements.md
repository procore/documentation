## Introduction
The Procore App Marketplace connects Procore customers with integrations that enhance their workflows and drive value. To be listed, apps must meet Procore's standards for quality, reliability, and utility. Below, we've highlighted a few insights on what customers look for in integrations:

- **Increase Operational Efficiency** – Streamline processes to save time and effort within Procore.
- **Create Visibility** – Ensure data, videos, or images are readily accessible when needed.
- **Provide Accuracy** – Maintain up-to-date and accurate information within Procore.
- **Introduce New Capabilities** – Deliver new abilities that enhance project outcomes.
- **Mitigate Risk** – Reduce potential risks like safety concerns or reliability issues.

## Steps to Success
Now that you have an idea of the minimum requirements to be listed on the Procore Marketplace, let's walk through the steps to get started.
<br><br>

<details>
<summary class="collapseListTierOne">1. Build & Test Your App</summary>
<p>
    The first step to getting started on the Procore Marketplace is building an app. To get started on your app building journey, you will need to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create and verify your <b>Developer Account</b> through the <a href="https://developers.procore.com/signup" target="_blank">Procore Developer Portal</a>.</li>
    <li>Create an app and add one of the available app types.</li>
    <li>Invite additional team members to your app.</li>
    <li>Access the automatically generated <b>Developer Sandbox</b>, which is your testing environment prior to deployment, and install your app using the <a href="https://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/admin/tutorials/install-a-custom-app" target="_blank">Install Custom App</a> flow to begin testing your app.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary class="collapseListTierOne">2. Gather Customer Feedback</summary>
<p>
    As you move towards publishing your app to the Procore Marketplace, gathering customer feedback becomes even more crucial. Running a pilot program with select customers can provide valuable insights into how your integration is used alongside Procore and ensuring it meets real-world needs.

    While building, keep these key points in mind:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Onboarding Experience:</b> Ensure that the integration is easy to onboard. Simplify the process as much as possible to reduce friction for your users.</li>
    <li><b>Data Connector Considerations:</b> If your app includes a data connector, carefully understand the difference between User Level and Service Account Authentication. While your app can utilize both, pick the one that aligns with your users' needs as it can significantly impact the customer experience.</li>
    <li><b>Customer Communication & Support:</b> Create 'Getting Started' guides or FAQs to help inform prospective customers and guide existing customers.</li>
    <li><b>Handling Multiple Procore Company Accounts:</b> Keep in mind that Procore users may be part of multiple company accounts. Ensure your app is designed to work seamlessly across different Procore company accounts.</li>
    <li><b>Enterprise Needs:</b> Build with enterprise-level customers in mind. Consider their privacy needs, security concerns, and how easy it is to scale your solution across large organizations.</li>
</ul>
