## Marketing Guidelines
As detailed in the <a href="https://www.procore.com/partners/documents" target="blank">Procore Partner Agreement</a>, Partners are responsible for accurately representing Procore and the partnership in all public facing materials produced by the Partner, including but not limited to press releases, social media copy, blogs, and webinar content. This includes ensuring compliance with the <a href="https://brand.procore.com/design/logos/?_gl=1*13n0feh*_gcl_au*Mjk3NzY4NjQxLjE3Mjg1MTUwNzY.*_ga*NTEyMTM3NDQ1LjE3MjM4MzU1NDk.*_ga_DDN1X7BZGJ*MTcyODg1NjMxNi42LjEuMTcyODg1Nzk3NS45LjAuMA..*_ga_0W3CW2NEWP*MTcyODg1NjMxNi4xMC4xLjE3Mjg4NTc5NzUuOS4wLjA.#overview" target="blank">Brand Use Guidelines</a>, <a href="https://www.procore.com/legal/trademark#otnotice-section-785579e4-abc0-4846-850b-cfb5bf95ab45" target="blank">Trademark Use Guidelines</a>, as well as the additional guidelines outlined below.

### Review Process
Partners are required to submit any public facing materials mentioning Procore for review to the Partner Programs & Experience team at <partnerprograms@procore.com>. Please include your desired launch timing for all public facing marketing collateral. Procore will aim to provide a response within 7-10 business days. Once approved, you are responsible for the logistics and costs of distribution, and announcement timing must be conducted in the approved window provided by Procore. 

Please note that Procore does not make public announcements during its quarterly quiet periods, which typically take place two weeks prior to our quarterly earnings announcements or during the quiet period around Groundbreak, Procore’s annual construction innovation event. All requests for external communications during these timeframes will be delayed until the conclusion of the corresponding quiet period.

### Enforcement Actions
Partners that do not comply with Procore’s <a href="https://brand.procore.com/design/logos/?_gl=1*13n0feh*_gcl_au*Mjk3NzY4NjQxLjE3Mjg1MTUwNzY.*_ga*NTEyMTM3NDQ1LjE3MjM4MzU1NDk.*_ga_DDN1X7BZGJ*MTcyODg1NjMxNi42LjEuMTcyODg1Nzk3NS45LjAuMA..*_ga_0W3CW2NEWP*MTcyODg1NjMxNi4xMC4xLjE3Mjg4NTc5NzUuOS4wLjA.#overview" target="blank">Brand Use Guidelines</a>, <a href="https://www.procore.com/legal/trademark#otnotice-section-785579e4-abc0-4846-850b-cfb5bf95ab45" target="_blank">Trademark Usage Guidelines</a>,  and other applicable policies will be subject to a partnership review and possible change in program benefits, including loss of status as a Procore Partner, per the Partner Agreement. 

Actions taken may include, without limitation, declining all citation requests from companies with active citation violations as well as demands to remove content. If you have questions about what constitutes a violation, or you believe that you have found a violation, please contact us at <partnerprograms@procore.com>.
