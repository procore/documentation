## Define Setup Instructions and Post‑Installation Notes

You must provide setup instructions and post-installation notes to help Procore users complete the installation and setup of your application in a Procore project.

Clear post-installation guidance is required to ensure users know exactly what to do after installing your app. For example, they may need to sign up for an external account, configure settings on your platform, or complete authentication steps before the app can be used.

These instructions are displayed to the user immediately after installation and remain accessible in the App Management section of the Procore Admin Tool.

To populate the install notes, expand the **Instructions and Post-Installation Notes** section, and follow these steps to define setup instructions:

1. In the **Instructions URL** field, enter a link to your company’s support site or a page with step-by-step setup instructions.
2. In the **Instructions Page Name** field, enter the label you want to display as the hyperlink text for the Instructions URL.
3. In the **Post-Installation Notes** field, add any additional details or reminders the users need to complete setup successfully.
