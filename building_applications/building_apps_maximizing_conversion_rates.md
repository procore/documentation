### Overview

Procore customers seek to realize value through integrations.
This document offers specific guidance to maximize your Marketplace Listing’s conversion - installs, contact form submits, and purchases - from customers in the Procore Marketplace.
General guidance about what customers are looking for with integrations is provided for your Marketplace Listing.
Specific guidance and best practices for each field is also included.

**Note**: This help article is a current snapshot - as more insights and information are gathered from Procore customers, the article will be updated to provide the best practices for maximizing conversion rate on the Procore Marketplace. 

## In General, What are Customers Looking For?

Customers tell us they are looking to realize value from integrations.
Any of the following values, or a combination:

* **Operational Efficiency** - saving time, effort, not having to leave Procore
* **Visibility** - data, video, images in the right place, at the right time
* **Accuracy** - leveraging a single source of information within Procore
* **Capability** - additional ability, results, inputs, capacity
* **Risk Mitigation** - Seen or unforeseen risk, reliability, safety, litigation related

They also tell us they are constantly evaluating their businesses and seeking to realize value with Procore through integrations.
The values realized by an integration are compared to the costs: software costs, labor costs to operate, etc.

Here are some of the common themes we hear from customers:

* “Can that integration save us a few steps every week?"
* “Providing visibility of the data within Procore means we know the data is accurate, and it saves us time from having to leave Procore.”
* “That integration provides visibility and capability we do not have today.”    

### Providing Evidence of Value Realization is Critical

Customers also tell us they want to know how an integration works with Procore and see a demonstration of the value it realizes.
This information is often shared within their entire organization, and is critical to making a purchase decision.
A testimonial we often hear from customers is:

"Once we saw that integration in action, we were convinced it would meet the needs of our project teams.”

The evidence of value realization can take many forms:

* **Video** - demonstration of the integration
* **Testimonial** - your customer’s testimonial about your Procore integration
* **Case Study** - evidence of business outcomes resulting from your integration
* **Free Trial** - customers tell us trials effectively make the case for purchase
* **Demonstration** - booking a demo to see the integration and ask questions

Having this evidence available within your Marketplace Listing, or linked, allows a Procore customer to efficiently and effectively know your value proposition.

### Compatibility and Prerequisites Qualify Effectively

Customers tell us they view the Marketplace as the source of truth of what integrations are available for Procore.
They arrive in the Marketplace ready to make decisions and learn what will work, and work best, for their usage of Procore.

Providing accurate and complete compatibility and prerequisite information is how a customer decides to pursue an integration, or look elsewhere.
The Procore Marketplace is a competitive environment where there is advantage in making it more efficient for a customer to understand prerequisites and compatibility.
Customers tell us they value ‘mitigating risk’, providing compatibility and prerequisites demonstrates your mitigating risk for prospective customers.

## Creating a Marketplace Listing to Maximize Conversion

Your Marketplace Listing’s conversion is directly related to the content you provide.
This section is to help you decide what content to include in each field and input into your Marketplace Listing.
And a method to measure your conversion rate, so you can decide to make changes in your Listing content.
Let's walk through each step of creating your Marketplace Listing.

### App Tab

#### 1. Name

The name of your App that appears in your Listing Title, in search results, and in App categories.
Be succinct as possible so it reads clearly.
Your ‘tagline’ appears below the title so you can use the tagline field to provide additional context for your title.

![Listing Name]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guides/conversion-rate-app-name.png)

Some rules that apply to your Name:

* Must not include the word Procore anywhere in the name.
* Must not contain the name of the developer, ISV, or other entity that created the App.
* Procore makes the final determination on whether your proposed App name is acceptable and suitable for the Marketplace, looking for the name to be as clear and intuitive as possible for Procore customers to discover.

#### 2. Built By

The name of your company distinguishes your company from others who have built integrations in the Marketplace.
Including Procore, who has built several integrations in the Marketplace.

#### 3. Description

There are three primary areas to describe in the Marketeplace Listing: Description, Features, and How it Works.

* **‘Features’** are 3 brief text entries that appear at the top of your Listing.
* **‘How it Works’** is to describe how your integration works with Procore and your App.
* **‘Description’** is to describe what functionality your App provides.

Be sure to use this section to provide information on how your integration is valuable to the customer.
A best practice is for the description to highlight any of the values Procore customers are seeking from integrations:

* **Operational Efficiency** - saving time, effort, not having to leave Procore to accomplish a task
* **Visibility** - data, video, images in the right place, at the right time
* **Accuracy** - leveraging a single source of information within Procore
* **Capability** - additional ability, results, inputs, capacity
* **Risk Mitigation** - Seen or unforeseen risk, reliability, safety, litigation related

As customers look to justify a purchase, the evidence of values realized by the integration are key components of the decision.
The words in your Listing are used as search terms so including common use cases can help customers find your Listing when using search terms.

#### 4. Tagline

The tagline appears right below the Title of the Listing in search, categories, and the Listing itself.
Best practice is to keep it succinct and make it accurate and compelling to justify the click into the Listing.
If a customer is not familiar with your App, the tagline can help them understand quickly and compel them to click into your Listing.

The tagline must not exceed 40 characters in length.

![Listing Tagline]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guides/conversion-rate-app-tagline.png)

#### 5. About Your Company

About Your Company is not only to describe your company to the customer, but also the opportunity to provide information about how your customers value what you are providing.
This can include testimonials, key clients, and case studies.
Procore customers tell us they are not just evaluating your integration, they are evaluating your company, support, and service.

#### 6. Category

In selecting a Category, accuracy is critical, along with the description content.
For any category selected, your Listing description should provide information, such as benefits, that relates to the category.
Customers tell us they lose trust if they find a Listing in a category where the Listing itself does not describe how it benefits or specifically relates to the category selected.

#### 7. How it Works

The customer reading your Listing is often an administrator role, responsible for Procore and integrations within their organization.
The best practice for How it Works is to provide visibility into how the integration works with the App.
A separate section in the Listing provides ‘Integration Requirements’, so use this section to describe how it works.
Consider including any important information that is not shown in any image or video.
The visibility provides confidence for the administrator in the evaluation of your integration.

### Regions Tab

#### Available Regions and Countries

![Regions]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guides/conversion-rate-regions.png)

**Note**: Not all available regions and countries are shown in the illustration above.
Visit the Regions tab to see the complete list.

Select the geographic regions and countries where your App is available.
Your Marketplace tile displays these settings so potential customers can determine whether your App can be used effectively in the regions and countries where their projects are located. 

As you define the available regions and countries for your App, consider aspects such as language, currency, time zones, regulatory requirements, cultural norms, or other constraints that may exist within specific regions/countries.

### Support Tab

#### 1. Support Email

For customers who have your App, this is the email address for the support for your App.

#### 2. Support Website Label

This is the text label for the website of your support URL that appears on your Listing.

#### 3. Support Website URL

This is the URL for the support website for your App.

### Features Tab

#### Features (3 fields)

The three feature fields appear as bullet points at the top of the Listing directly below the Media slider containing images and videos. 

![Features]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guides/conversion-rate-features.png)

Be aware the subtitle for the Features section is automatically generated:

#### With  &lt;App Name> you can:

Not only are the Features the first text and first impression of your App, this subtitle is a specific introduction to the Features as capabilities, value propositions, and benefits.

The best practice is to use the three Features sections to provide the value propositions for your App in a clear and succinct way.
Below the Features are the Description and How it Works sections which allow you to provide the “what” and “how” for your App – these three feature sections should be about the “why” for customers.

### Links Tab

#### Link URL (3 fields available) and Link Label

The best practice is to use all three fields and use each to reward a customer’s curiosity about your App.
Customers tell us if there is a free trial available that is highly valuable and convincing for their interest.
If a trial or offer is available, be certain to mention it in your Listing, and a best practice would be to link directly to it so you can maximize conversions.
Similarly, if a demo or more demo videos are available, be sure to link to those as well.

Customers are also curious about how to install and configure the integration.
If you have instructions you can link to, this provides visibility to the customer.
It also helps establish trust as it is an indicator of how you are supporting your customer from the very beginning of their integration.

In general, you can link to your company’s website, solution documentation, or anything that would provide more value to customers to know.
Consider: if a customer can not see the information on your Listing, or link to information from the Listing, how will they get the information they need to know? Listing content and links answer questions and help a customer make decisions.

### Required Procore Tools Tab

#### Required Procore Tools

These are the Procore tools that are required for your App to function properly.
They are also how customers determine if your App will work with the Procore Tools they have configured, so be sure to be accurate and complete in your selections.

If you update your application manifest and require more or different Procore tools, be certain to update your Required Procore Tool selections in your Listing.

### Integration Requirements Tab

#### Integration Requirements

Similar to the How it Works section, the best practice is to provide visibility to any prerequisites that must be met in order for your App to function properly. Be sure to note any:

* Proper subscriptions
* Proper licensing
* Third-party systems, etc. 
* Specific permission settings in Procore that are required to administer or use your App. 
	
**Best Practice - If the integration is free:**

If your integration is free, be certain to mention it here and be certain to use 
the word “free”, such as:

***“Free integration with subscription to &lt;your solution/software>"***

Customers tell us knowing that an integration is free, saves them time and effort from having to figure it out.
It is one less uncertainty that could slow or prevent conversion, and it allows the customer to focus on acquiring your solution/software subscription, knowing the integration is free once they have the subscription. 

For each Procore tool your App integrates with, indicate whether Read Only, Standard, or Admin permissions are required.
Customers tell us that Apps that provide accurate and complete integration requirements in the Listing help them build confidence in the App and the company providing the App.

### Media Tab

#### Logo

The specific requirements for the logo assure it looks best as it is displayed on the Listing, in search results, and category pages.
Image dimensions must be 200 x 200 px with a transparent or white background.

* Must be one of the following formats: .EPS, .SVG, .AI, or .PNG.
* Must not resemble the Procore logo/icon 
* Must not infringe on any trademarked or copyrighted work.

#### Screenshots

Customer data indicate Listings with images provided receive high engagement.
While three images are the minimum, consider adding images that show the value proposition of the integration for Procore customers.
Icons, title art, marketing slogans should be lower priority than showing the value of the integration.

Each image can be expanded within the Listing, but it is important to adhere to the resolution limits so the image renders properly.
Aspect ratio can be anywhere between 4:3 and 16:9 with minimum resolution 720x480 and maximum resolution 1920x1080

#### Videos

Videos may be one of the most important elements of your Listing when it comes to conversion rate.
Not only do customers tell us they rely on videos to make decisions, the Marketplace usage data indicates videos receive very high engagement.
Nearly half of the video plays on the Marketplace watch the entire video.

Customers tell us they are looking to see the integration “in action” and in all ways it can be valuable for their business, and they share these videos with their teams and decision makers in their organization.
The best practice is to prioritize a demonstration over just high level marketing content (can also use Links to product marketing and documentation).

The video is also the first image a customer sees on your Listing.
For the key frame, it can be an icon or marketing, a best practice would make the remainder of the video demo content.
Also consider the key frame having a title that indicates the video demonstrates the value of your solution and integration in action.

Try to answer the following question from a customer perspective:

***“How is this App and integration valuable when I am using Procore?”***

Customers tell us they want to demonstrate the value of an App to their teams inside their organization and that a video is a very effective and efficient means to demonstrate value.
Customers tell us when they see the integration in action it is especially convincing when it demonstrates any of the five value realizations: Operational Efficiency, Accuracy, Visibility, Capability and/or Risk Mitigation.

Be sure to follow the file format guidelines to assure a quality presentation:

* MP4 or .MOV
* Minimum resolution: 720p, 24fps screen recording.

**Congratulations! You have successfully completed a Marketplace Listing using best practices learned from Procore customers.**

### After Your Listing Goes Live

Once your Listing goes live, the next step is to monitor your conversion rate in the Developer Portal.

A best practice is to ask customers that have come to you from the Procore Marketplace what content or information they found useful, how they decided to pursue your solution, and what questions they may still have.
Each of these answers may lead to more valuable information to include (or exclude) from your Listing.
The most important information for your Listing may not be on the page today and a prospect or new customer may help you discover what is missing or needs improvement.

The good news is that for any improvement or change you make to your Listing, you are always able to monitor conversion rate in the Developer Portal. Are you able to convert more visits into installations and contacts with your improved content?

## Using Metrics to Monitor Conversion Rate

Your Listing’s conversion is directly related to the content you provide, and there is a method to monitor your conversion.
In the Developer Portal, under your App is the Metrics tab that has everything you need to monitor conversion rate over time.

This section describes the key measures and how to calculate your conversion rate over time.

![AppEngagement]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guides/conversion-rate-app-engagement.png)

### Key Measures

#### Marketplace Visits

A visit is when a customer or prospect visits your Listing. It is reported on a daily basis, and is charted over time.

#### Company Installations

A company installation is when a unique customer installs the App. It is reported on a daily basis, and is charted over time.

#### Activity column

The column on the right is the installation activity, indicating specifically who and when installed the App:

* Procore Account (Company) Name
* Date and time of installation

### Calculating Conversion Rate

#### About Conversion Rate

Conversion Rate is a method to measure how well your Listing content is convincing prospective Procore customers to install your App.
The Listing content may not be the only influence on a customer as they may have engaged your Company/Sales, received a recommendation from another customer, or viewed your marketing.

What can be measured is were there visits to the Listing, and were there installations.
Use conversion rate as an indicator, rather than the only reason or cause.
You always want to have the best value proposition in your Listing content to compel conversion if the customer has not completely decided.

It is a best practice as you change or update your content to monitor if it is impacting your conversion rate.

#### Measuring Conversion Rate

Conversion rate is calculated by taking the Company Installations and dividing by the Marketplace Visits, the resulting percentage is the *Conversion Rate*.
For example, dividing the 106 Company Installations by the 2066 Marketplace Visits results in a conversion rate of 5.1%.

![EngagementCalc]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guides/conversion-rate-engagement-calc.png)

This 5.1% Conversion Rate is a “total” calculation of all visits and all installations since the Listing has been available on the Marketplace.
You can also use the daily data to provide a more recent calculation.
This is useful if you have made recent changes to your Listing content.

![DailyCalc]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guides/conversion-rate-daily-calc.png)

What is a good conversion rate?
This can vary by the type or category of App.
The content that may convert best may not be on your Listing currently, like a better video or value proposition.
As you improve and update your Listing, the results of your efforts can be measured by conversion rate.

Customers are visiting your Listing, so learn from the customers you have contact with what they found most valuable so you can always be maximizing your convertion rate! -->
