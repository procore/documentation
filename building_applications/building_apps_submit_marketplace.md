After you have completed the development phase of your integration project, you may consider submitting your App for publication on the Procore Marketplace.
The following steps outline the process for submitting your application package.

1. On each of the tabs in the Marketplace Listing section of your App page, enter the information you want to display on the App tile that customers see on the Marketplace. Refer to [Marketplace Listing Requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link overview/partner_content_reqs.md %}) for additional details. Note: You can now choose up to three categories under which your App will be listed on the Marketplace.
1. After entering your information, click **Save Draft**. Note that you can return to and update any of the field values at a later time if you wish.
1. Once you are satisfied with your settings for the Marketplace Listing, click **Submit for Review**. You will be notified by email regarding the results of our review.

If you have any specific questions you can click **Contact Us** to reach out to our Marketplace validation team.
