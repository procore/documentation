Whether you are a Procore client or a Procore Technology partner, you can leverage the Procore API to build applications that interact directly with the data and resources available in Procore tools at both the company and project level.
The following sections detail the steps for building applications, or Apps, using the Procore API and provide you with the information you need to be successful in your development efforts.

Before embarking on your App development journey, be sure to complete the following tasks:

- [Set up your Developer Account]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting_started/new_account.md %}) on developers.procore.com.
- Learn about [partner integrations]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link app_marketplace/partner_overview.md %}) and [custom integrations]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link overview/custom_overview.md %}).
- Learn about the [Procore Sandbox Environments]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting_started/development_environments.md %}).
- Gain an understanding of [OAuth 2.0 Authentication]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link oauth/oauth_introduction.md %}).

Here are the high-level steps in the App development lifecycle:
