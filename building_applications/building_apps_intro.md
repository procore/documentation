<!-- ## Introduction
Whether you are a Procore client or a Procore Technology partner, you can leverage the Procore API to build applications that interact directly with the data and resources available in Procore. The following sections detail the steps for building applications, or Apps, and provide you with the information you need to be successful in your development efforts.

Before embarking on your App development journey, be sure to complete the following tasks:

- [Set up your Developer Account]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting_started/new_account.md %}) on developers.procore.com.
- Learn about [partner integrations]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link app_marketplace/partner_overview.md %}) and [custom integrations]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link overview/custom_overview.md %}).
- Learn about the [Procore Sandbox Environments]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link platform_concepts/development_environments.md %}).
- Gain an understanding of [OAuth 2.0 Authentication]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link oauth/oauth_introduction.md %}).

Here are the high-level steps in the App development lifecycle:

- [Selecting the Type of App to Build]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link plan_your_app/building_apps_app_types.md %})
- [Creating a New App]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link building_applications/building_apps_create_new.md %})
- [Creating an App Manifest]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link building_applications/building_apps_define_manifest.md %})
- [Promoting a Sandbox Manifest to Production]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link building_applications/building_apps_promote_manifest.md %})
- [Submitting a Production App Manifest for Review]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link building_applications/building_apps_review_manifest.md %})

For Marketplace Apps, the following step must also be completed:

- [Creating a Marketplace Listing and Submitting for Review]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link building_applications/building_apps_submit_marketplace.md %}) -->
