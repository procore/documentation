## Introduction
Procore's open Application Programming Interface (API) and robust Developer Portal provide the underlying framework for developing innovative applications. Our RESTful APIs, built on OAuth 2.0 standards, ensure secure and scalable integrations. Key features include comprehensive documentation, rate limits, and consistent versioning, making it easier for developers to build seamless integrations.

Any developer can build on top of Procore using the provided REST API and app framework. Our framework is designed to function independently of your technology stack, including programming languages, frameworks, and infrastructure. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting, Procore provides the tools and support to help you succeed.

## Who Can Use Your Procore App?
Whether you aim to create private apps for internal use or public apps for the Procore Marketplace, the Procore Developer Portal provides the tools and support needed to achieve your goals.

### Custom Apps
You can build and install custom apps exclusively for your organization or specific customers. These apps enable you to create tailored functionalities, automate workflows, and integrate with other systems seamlessly. Custom apps also allow you to display external services directly within Procore without leaving your workspace. Each new app version comes with an 'App Version Key,' which you can use to install the integration, ensuring secure and direct access without the need for public listing or app approval.

For detailed instructions on installing a custom app, visit <a href="https://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/admin/tutorials/install-a-custom-app" target="_blank">Install Custom App</a>.

### Marketplace Apps
Creating public apps allows you to share your innovations with the entire Procore customer base. Public apps, like private ones, enhance workflows and bridge gaps for users. The key difference is that public apps are listed on the Procore App Marketplace and require approval, making them available for customers and prospects to discover and install.

## How Do I Start Building An App?
To get started building your app today, create a <a href="https://developers.procore.com/signup" target="_blank">Developer Account</a> and verify your information. Once you have successfully signed into the Procore Developer Portal, simply click **Create App** and begin building your app.

After creating your desired app type, click **Create Version**, which will save your app and provide you with an App Version Key, which is used to <a href="https://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/admin/tutorials/install-a-custom-app" target="_blank">Install a Custom App</a>.

## How Can I Get A Procore Account For Testing?
For both Custom and Marketplace apps, Procore automatically generates a Developer Sandbox for every app you create. This sandbox serves as your primary testing environment, allowing you to develop, test, and refine your app before deployment.

It's important to note that only the app creator is automatically added to the developer sandbox. For detailed instructions on adding additional individuals, visit <a href="https://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/directory/tutorials/add-a-user-account-to-the-company-directory" target="_blank">Add a User Account to the Company Directory</a>.

## Where Can I Find The Procore APIs?
Procore offers an extensive library of publicly accessible APIs covering nearly all our product solutions. This library can be downloaded as an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) file for convenience, allowing you to upload it into tools like Postman for seamless API testing.

To view the Procore API documentation, click <a href="https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/docs/rest-api-overview" target="_blank">REST API</a>.

<!-- Procore's open Application Programming Interface (API) provides the underlying framework for developing applications and custom integrations between Procore and other software tools and technologies.
You can expand the functionality of your Procore account by leveraging existing integrations available in our Marketplace, or by developing new applications and customized connections yourself using the Procore API.

<!-- ## Procore API

If you intend to build your own applications (or hire someone to build them for you), the Procore API allows you to leverage Procore resources within the Procore cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests in a RESTful architecture.
The Procore API endpoints are intuitive and powerful, enabling you to easily make calls to retrieve information or execute actions on the various resources in Procore.

## Procore Marketplace

The Procore Marketplace serves as a clearing house for applications and integrations developed by our technology partners using the Procore API.
These offerings allow Procore clients to integrate Procore with their existing tools and workflows.
Integrations currently available in the Marketplace expand project management possibilities for Procore clients in the areas of Analytics, Business Intelligence, Accounting, Estimating, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and others.

## Developer Personas

The two primary developer personas that interact with the Procore API are _Procore Clients_ and _Procore Technology Partners_.
It is likely that you fall into one of these categories and that your specific integration goals and requirements can be characterized by one of these two Procore developer personas.

### Procore Clients

_Procore Clients_ are individuals and organizations that have one or more Procore accounts and utilize Procore for their daily project management activities.
It is not uncommon for clients to rely on a number of other software tools and processes in addition to Procore to manage their projects.
For example, a large general contracting firm may use a legacy tool for bidding/estimation, while using Procore for the balance of their project management tasks.
In this scenario, the GC could build (or hire a development team to build) a [Custom Integration]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link overview/custom_overview.md %}) between their legacy systems and Procore using the Procore API, thereby improving efficiency and upgrading the user experience for their employees and collaborators (subcontractors, vendors, etc.).
As a general rule, applications and integrations produced by Procore clients are intended for their own internal use and are not normally published to the Procore Marketplace.

### Procore Technology Partners

_Procore Technology Partners_ leverage the Procore API to provide Procore users with a best-in-class experience, irrespective of what problem they are seeking to solve.
In addition to making their [Partner Integrations]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link app_marketplace/partner_overview.md %}) available on the Procore Marketplace for purchase by Procore clients and users, members in the Procore Partnerships program benefit from exclusive access to the following resources:

- Brand presence on the Procore Marketplace
- Use of the Procore logo
- Developer training and support
- Development sandbox
- Opportunity to contribute to the The Jobsite publication
- Invitation to exhibit at Procoreâ€™s annual _Groundbreak_ conference

## Paths to Success

The two developer personas described in the previous sections take a slightly different path to a successful launch of their applications and integrations.
Generally speaking, Procore clients manage their own integration development milestones and releases.
Since their Custom Integrations are only used internally, they have complete control over quality, performance, and reliability requirements.
Procore clients also manage the internal training needs for their users.

Conversely, Procore technology partners take a different development path as their applications are intended for use by the Procore user community at-large, and therefore must adhere to more stringent standards when it comes to quality, performance, and security.
In addition, since technology partners have the opportunity to publish their [Partner Integrations]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link app_marketplace/partner_overview.md %}) on the Procore Marketplace, they must submit their applications to Procore for approval.
Finally, technology partners must provide adequate training materials and offer technical support services for their applications. -->
