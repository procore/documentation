## Submitting Information for a Marketplace Listing

We want to help you succeed, so we created this guide to ensure we have all the necessary content to properly publish your App on the [Procore Marketplace](https://marketplace.procore.com/).
We collect the information we need from the Marketplace Listing section of your App page on the Developer Portal, and additional material you provide to our App Validation Engineer.
Please ensure the content you supply for your Marketplace tile - descriptions, screenshots, video, etc. - accurately reflects the App’s core experience.

Once you have everything assembled you can log in to your Procore Developer Portal account and visit your App page to enter and submit information for your Marketplace listing.
The following sections summarize the various fields found in the Marketplace Listing section of your App page.
All field entries and selections are required unless otherwise noted.
