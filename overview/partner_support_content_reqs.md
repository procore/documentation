## Sales Team Training

Your sales team must be knowledgeable about the Procore integration and capable of supporting customers who may contact them regarding its use or implementation.

## Establish a Viable Support System

Critical to the success of your App/integration is the availability of a viable and capable support system.
You must provide a means for customers to easily contact your support team via email and/or telephone.
The first line of support for troubleshooting issues with your App should be done by your support team.
Customers should not be directed to Procore Support for help with your App.
If your team finds a possible technical problem with your integration and Procore, they can escalate the issue to their Procore Partner Manager to coordinate a resolution to the problem.
Procore Support is not equiped to troubleshoot technical issues with an integration.
Please work with your Procore Partner Manager and our publisher team to debug technical issues with your integration.
