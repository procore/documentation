name: Deploy Staging to GitHub Pages

# This workflow deploys to procore-staging.github.io/documentation/
#
# Triggers:
# 1. When any branch starting with "staging-" is pushed (e.g., staging-my-feature)
#    → Deploys that feature branch's content to staging
# 2. When main branch is merged/pushed
#    → Deploys main branch's content to procore-staging.github.io
#    → This keeps staging in sync with the latest main branch content
#
# Both scenarios deploy to the same staging subdomain: procore-staging.github.io

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'staging-*'  # Deploy when any branch starting with "staging-" is updated (e.g., staging-1, staging-feature)
      - main         # Deploy main branch to procore-staging.github.io when main is merged/pushed
