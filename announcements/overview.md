>**Sunset of Traditional Service Accounts** (updated 01/29/2025)
>
>*All Traditional Service Accounts will sunset on March 18, 2025.*
>
>Traditional Service Accounts were deprecated on December 9, 2021.
>Beginning January 21, 2025, we will no longer allow the creation of new Traditional Service Accounts.
>Existing Traditional Service Accounts will continue to function until March 18, 2025.
>
>In accordance with this timeline, developers of data connection applications that currently use Traditional Service Accounts are required to update their applications to use Developer Managed Service Accounts, and customers will be required to install these updated applications before the sunset date.
>All data connection applications not migrated by the sunset date will cease to function.
>Any application listed on the Procore App Marketplace that is not using a supported method for accessing the Procore API will be removed by the sunset date.
>See [Deprecation of Traditional Service Accounts]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link announcements/service_account_deprecation.md %}) and [Migrating Data Connection Applications to Use DMSAs](https://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/admin/tutorials/migrating-to-dmsa) for additional information.
>If you have questions regarding this change, please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).

>**OAuth access token expiration time reduced to 5400 seconds** (09/26/2023)
>
>As part of the planned transition to shorter duration OAuth access tokens, token expiration time has been reduced from 7200 seconds (2 hours) to 5400 seconds (1.5 hours).
>If you have questions regarding this change, please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).

>**Procore-Company-Id Request Header Requirement** (08/04/2023)
>
>As described in [Request Header Requirements for Multiple Procore Regions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link best_practices/mpz_headers.md %}), the `Procore-Company-Id` request header is required to successfully make calls to the Procore API (api.procore.com), regardless of region.
>If you have yet to incorporate the `Procore-Company-Id` request header into your integration designs, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible.
>If you have questions regarding this requirement, please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).

>**Expiration of OAuth access tokens and OAuth Revoke endpoint are changing** (08/04/2023)
>
>*Effective: NOVEMBER 17, 2023 6PM PT*
>
>**What's changing?**
>
>Beginning on NOVEMBER 17, 2023 6PM PT, Procore OAuth access tokens will be generated with a shorter expiration time.
>Tokens currently expire 2 hours after they are generated.
>After this change, tokens will expire 15 minutes after being generated.
>The `expires_in` parameter returned with tokens will always reflect the amount of time that the token will expire (initially 7200 seconds) so if your integration is following that parameter, or automatically refreshing the access token when receiving an HTTP 401 error for an expired token, then you should not need to make any changes to your integration.
>However, if you've hardcoded the current 2 hour refresh time, then you will need to update your integration to match the new 15 minute expiration time.
>We strongly recommend following the `expires_in` parameter for refreshing access tokens, and not hardcoding a refresh time.
>
>This change will also affect the current Procore OAuth [revoke]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link oauth/oauth_endpoints.md %}) process.
>To follow OAuth best practices, we are shifting towards revoking _only_ renewal tokens instead of simultaneously revoking renewal and access tokens.
>The `/oauth/revoke` endpoint currently revokes both access and renewal tokens but in the future this endpoint will _only_ revoke renewal tokens since access tokens will no longer be valid after 15 minutes.
><u>Between now and NOVEMBER 17, 2023 6PM PT Procore will periodically shorten the 2 hour window to begin this transition.</u>
>
>**When is this happening?**
>
>This change will affect new access tokens starting on NOVEMBER 17.
>Any access tokens created before this change will be valid for their full lifetime based on the `expires_in` parameter received at the time the token was generated.
>
>If you have questions regarding this change, please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).

><a id="file-link-url-schema-change" />**File Link URL Schema Change** (06/28/2023)
>
>Starting June 30, 2024, the URL schema for file API responses and redirects will be changing.
>Today, file links have the following structure: `https://storage.procore.com/…` and they redirect to `https://s3.amazonaws.com/…`.
>But in the future, file links will have a more general structure of `https://*.procore.com/…` and they will redirect to `https://*/… `.
>
> Note that a file link should be considered an opaque URL when used and no attempt should be made to build logic around the URL itself, or attempt to generate one (unless documented on our developer portal).
>If the file link domain (or domain from any subsequent redirects) ends in ".procore.com" a valid access token will need to be included unless otherwise documented.
>At the same time, Procore access tokens should not be sent/shared with non-Procore domains (like cloud service partner domains from any subsequent redirects).
>
>One example of an affected endpoint whose output contains file links is [Project Folders and Files](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/project-folders-and-files?version=1.0#list-project-folders-and-files).
>The file link schema change will not only affect this endpoint but will also affect any other endpoint where file links are returned in the response (i.e., images, attachments, etc).
>
>For example, the file URL in API responses will change from:
>
>* `https://storage.procore.com/v4/d/us-east-1/pro-core.com/companies/…`
>
>&emsp;&emsp;to:
>
>* `https://us02.procore.com/fas/api/v5/us-east-1/pro-core.com/companies/…`
>or
`https://app.procore.com/fas/api/v5/us-east-1/pro-core.com/companies/…`
>
>Redirects for the above URL will change from:
>
>* `https://s3.amazonaws.com/prostore-apse2/…`
>
>&emsp;&emsp;to:
>* `https://prostore-apse2.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/…`
>
>The file link URL schema change is required for Procore to roll out our new file access service and to support the changes that our cloud service partner, Amazon Web Services, is making on their platform.
>Before the target date we’re planning to enable this change in the developer and monthly sandbox environments for you to be able to test your integrations.
>We expect that most integrations will not be impacted by the above changes, but those that have strict limitations on incoming/outgoing URLs, need to be carefully tested.
>
>If your integration requires direct access to files in storage.procore.com, we encourage you to begin planning for this change now.
>If you have questions regarding this new requirement, please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).

>**Monthly Sandbox Refresh July Schedule** (07/12/2023)
>
>Due to the holiday timing on the first of the month, the Monthly Sandbox refresh will occur on July 11th for the July refresh.

>**Maintenance Update (11/16/2022)**
>We are still working on maintenance work and will extend the maintenance until Friday, November 18th 5:00 PM PST. Details below have been updated to reflect this change.
>
>
>To improve the performance and reliability of the Development Sandbox, we will conduct maintenance beginning on Monday, November 14th, at approximately 9:00 AM PST and expect it to complete by approximately Friday, November 18th 5:00 PM PST.  During this time, the Development Sandbox will not be available. The full impact and schedule are summarized below:
>
> - We will take a snapshot of the Development Sandbox on Friday, November 11th.  Please refrain from writing any new data to the Development Sandbox between 12:00 AM PST Friday, November 11th, and the completion of the maintenance at 5:00 PM PST on Friday, November 18th.
>   - Data written to the environment between taking the snapshot and completing the maintenance window may not be restored.
>   - Creating new application manifests will also be temporarily disabled between when the snapshot is taken and the maintenance is complete.
> - Beginning Monday, November 14th, between approximately 9 AM PST and until Friday, November 18th 5:00 PM PST, the Development Sandbox will not be available. Please note that this only impacts the Development Sandbox and does not impact the Monthly Sandbox.
> - When the environment is restored at approximately 5:00 PM PST on Friday, November 18th, the data will be from the snapshot taken on Friday, November 11th.
> - After the maintenance is complete, webhooks will continue to be unavailable for approximately one week while we roll out some additional enhancements to resolve the current scale and reliability issues of webhooks in the Development Sandbox.
>
>If you have questions regarding this maintenance, please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).

>**Procore-Company-Id Request Header Requirement** (06/16/2022)
>
>As described in [Request Header Requirements for Multiple Procore Regions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link best_practices/mpz_headers.md %}), the `Procore-Company-Id` request header is required to successfully make calls to the Procore API (api.procore.com), regardless of region.
>If you have yet to incorporate the `Procore-Company-Id` request header into your integration designs, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible.
>If you have questions regarding this requirement, please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).

><a id="bearer-token-to-be-required-for-file-access-authorization" />**Bearer Token to be Required for File Access Authorization** (06/10/2022)
>
>Starting June 1, 2023 an authorization bearer token will be required in the request header for accessing any Procore file or document URL.
>Today, an authorization token is not required to access a file directly from storage.procore.com, but it will be a requirement in the future in order to strengthen file access security.
>This change will not only affect files in the Documents tool but will affect any tool where access to file storage is supported (i.e., images, attachments, etc).
>
>For example:
>```
>curl -X GET https://storage.procore.com/v4/d/us-east-1/pro-core.com/companies/xxxx/xxxxxx?sig=xxxxxxx \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <access token>”
>```
>
>If your integration requires direct access to files in storage.procore.com, we encourage you to begin planning for this change now.
>If you have questions regarding this new requirement, please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).

>**Work Breakdown Structure Release and Deprecation of Financial Line Item Endpoints** (03/31/2022)
>
> With the release of [Work Breakdown Structure](https://developers.procore.com/documentation/tutorial-wbs), the following financial line item endpoints that utilize `cost_code`, `cost_type` and `sub_job` attributes will be deprecated on March 31, 2022.
>
> - [List Standard Cost Code Lists](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/cost-codes?version=1.0#list-standard-cost-code-lists) (replaced by [List Company WBS Segment Item Lists](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/segment-item-lists?version=1.0#list-company-wbs-segment-item-lists))
> - [Delete Standard Cost Code](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/cost-codes?version=1.0#delete-standard-cost-code) (replaced by [Delete Company Segment Item](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/segment-items?version=1.0#delete-company-segment-item))
> - [Delete Sub Job](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/sub-jobs?version=1.0#delete-sub-job) (replaced by [Delete Project Segment Item](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/segment-items?version=1.0#delete-project-segment-item))
>
> These endpoints will continue to function as they do currently until a sunset date is determined.
> At this time we plan to support these deprecated endpoints for the foreseeable future, but we encourage developers to start migrating to the new endpoints.
> See [API Lifecycle](https://developers.procore.com/documentation/rest-api-lifecycle) for additional information.
> If your existing integration uses any of these deprecated endpoints, or Cost Code, Cost Type and Sub Job endpoints in general, we encourage you to adopt the new [Work Breakdown Structure endpoints](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/codes?version=1.0) and update your integration as needed.
> If you have any concerns please reach out to [apisupport@procore.com](mailto:apisupport@procore.com).
