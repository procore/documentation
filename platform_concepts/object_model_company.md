## Projects

Client Accounts (Companies) have one or more Projects where project management activities occur.
Sometimes, a Project in Procore may be referred to as a Job.
Projects are managed on the [Porfolio](https://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/portfolio) page at the Company level.
See Portfolio for additional information.

API Endpoints: [Projects](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/projects)

## Company Directory

The Company-level Directory tool lets you create, import, and store an unlimited number of contacts in Procore.
See [Directory](https://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/directory) for additional information.

### Users (Contacts/Person)

In Procore, a _person_ is a record that can be created to represent either a Procore User or a Vendor/Company Contact.

- A Procore User is a person who will be logging into your organization's Procore account so they can enter and modify information in your company's Procore account.
- A Vendor/Company Contact is a person who will NOT be invited to log into your company's Procore account for the purpose of entering data in the Procore application. Examples of Vendor/Company Contacts include subcontractors, suppliers, vendors, or other contacts for third-party business entities.

Both Users and Vendor/Company Contacts are added to Procore the same way.
The only difference between the two is whether or not you choose to invite a person to log into Procore.
Note that if you add a user to the Project Directory they will also be created in the Company Directory.
See [Add a Person to the Company Directory](http://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/directory/tutorials/add-a-person-to-the-company-directory) for additional informtion.

### Vendors

The Company Level has a directory containing Vendors, also known as Directory Companies.
Not to be confused with Client Accounts, a Vendor represents a record that is created for subcontractors, suppliers, vendors, and other entities who are doing business with your organization.
It contains important address, contact, project, bidding, and insurance information that gives you a snapshot view of that entity, and makes it easier to communicate with the people working for the company.
See [Add a Company to a Company Directory](http://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/directory/tutorials/add-a-company-to-the-company-directory) for additional information.

#### Vendor Insurance

In Procore, an _Insurance Manager_ is an internal employee at your company who serves as your organization's primary point of contact for ensuring that the insurance policies for your vendors (e.g., contractors, subcontractors, and other vendors) are in compliance with liability requirements, and that their policy and certificate information is kept up-to-date in Procore.
Insurance information for your vendors can be added and maintained in Procore's Company and Project level Directory tools.
The responsibilities of an Insurance Manager include:

- Adding insurance policies for your vendors to the Directory tool
- Receiving automated email notifications from Procore about expiring insurance policies for your vendors
- Updating insurance policies as information changes
- Removing insurance information for your vendors when the information is no longer relevant

See [Add Insurance for a Vendor in the Company Directory](http://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/directory/tutorials/add-insurance-for-a-vendor-in-the-company-directory) for additional information.

Offering virtually unlimited storage space and a variety of markup and revision management features, you can ensure that your staff always has access to the most current document versions available.
