## Core

![Project-level Core Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guides/resource-model-project-level-core.svg)

## Project Directory

Procore's Project-level Directory tool stores all of your project-specific contact information.
Contacts can be employees, project team members, or other business entities, such as subcontractors or vendors.
A user assigned 'Admin' permissions to the Directory tool can add contacts so their information is available for use in Procore, or they can invite contacts to join Procore so they can log into the system as an end user.
See [Directory](http://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/directory) for additional infomation.

### Project Users (Contacts)

Users in the Company Directory include all users given access to any aspect of the Company, including the projects within the Company.
If a user is added to the Project Directory they will also be added to the Company Directory.
See [Add a Person to the Project Directory](http://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/directory/tutorials/add-person-to-project-directory) for additional infomation.

API Endpoints: [Project Users](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/project-users)

### Project Vendors

The Company level has a directory containing vendors, also known as Directory Companies.
Not to be confused with Client Accounts, these are the vendors who are working for the Company.
See [Add a Company to the Project Directory](http://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/project-level/directory/tutorials/add-a-company-to-the-project-directory) for additional infomation.

API Endpoints: [Project Vendors](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/project-vendors)

#### Project Vendor Insurances

In Procore, an insurance manager is an internal employee at your company who serves as your organization's primary point of contact for ensuring that the insurance policies for your vendors (e.g., contractors, subcontractors, and other vendors) are in compliance with legal requirements, and that their policy and certificate information is kept up to date in Procore.
Insurance information for your vendors can be added and maintained in Procore's Company and Project-level Directory tools.
The responsibilities of an insurance manager include:

- Adding insurance policies for your vendors to the Directory tool.
- Receiving automated email notifications from Procore regarding expiring insurance policies for your vendors.
- Updating insurance policies as information changes.
- Removing insurance information for your vendors when the information is no longer relevant.
